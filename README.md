# Full-Stack E-commerce Microservices Platform üõçÔ∏è

**Live Application:** https://your-app-url.aws.com ([YOUR LIVE APPLICATION URL HERE])

This repository contains the source code for a comprehensive, full-stack e-commerce application. The platform is built using a modern microservices architecture, featuring separate services for product management, user authentication, and an AI-powered chatbot.

The stack includes a Go (Echo) backend, a React frontend, a Python AI service, and a complete CI/CD pipeline deploying to AWS using Docker and GitHub Actions.

# üèõÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

The application is decomposed into distinct microservices to ensure scalability, separation of concerns, and independent deployment.

- **frontend-client (React):**
  - The main user-facing application. It provides the UI for browsing products, managing the cart, handling payments, and interacting with all backend services.

- **products-service (Go):**
  - A robust backend service built with the Echo framework. It handles all e-commerce logic, including:
    - Product catalog management (CRUD)
    - Product categories and relations
    - Shopping cart operations  
  - Uses GORM for ORM and database interaction.

- **auth-service (Go):**
  - A dedicated service for user identity. It manages:
    - Local user registration and login (email/password)
    - Server-side Google OAuth2 flow
    - JWT generation and token management.

- **chatbot-service (Python):**
  - An independent service that provides AI assistance to users.
  - Includes its own frontend interface (or is integrated into the main React app).
  - A Python backend service queries an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
  - Filters LLM requests to stay on-topic (store inventory, clothing, etc.).

# ‚ú® Core Features

## Backend: Products & Cart (Go)

- RESTful API: A clean API built with the Echo framework.  
- Full CRUD Functionality: The products-service provides complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for products.  
- Data Modeling: Uses GORM to map Go structs to database tables for Products, Categories, and Carts.  
- Relational Data: Manages the relationship between Products and Categories (e.g., one-to-many or many-to-many).  
- Cart Management: Dedicated models and API endpoints for adding/removing items from a user's cart.

## Frontend (React)

- Component-Based UI: Built with two primary components:
  - **Products:** Fetches and displays product data from the products-service.
  - **Payments:** A form component that submits payment and order data to the backend.  
- Client-Side Routing: Uses React Router to provide a seamless multi-page experience, including a dedicated view for the shopping cart.  
- Modern State Management: Leverages React Hooks (e.g., useState, useContext, useEffect) to manage and propagate state (like cart contents and user data) across all components.

## Authentication (OAuth2 & Local)

- Local Registration: Standard email and password registration handled by the auth-service.  
- Local Login: Secure session/token-based login for registered users.  
- Google OAuth2 (Server-Side): A secure, server-managed OAuth2 flow.
  - The auth-service acts as the OAuth2 client.
  - User data and provider tokens are stored securely in the server's database.
  - The server generates its own custom JWT, which is sent to the React client for session management.  
- Security: This flow explicitly avoids storing provider tokens or secrets on the client side.

## AI Chatbot Service (Python)

- Separate Service: A complete Python application for handling user chat.  
- Frontend Interface: A dedicated UI for users to interact with the bot.  
- LLM Integration: The Python backend service connects to ChatGPT to generate responses.  
- Domain Filtering: Intelligently filters user queries to ensure the LLM only responds to questions related to the e-commerce store, its products (clothing), and general store information.  
- Natural Conversation: Includes a predefined list of 5 different conversation openers and closers to feel more natural.

> Note: A local Ollama model was tested during development, but the production service is designed to target the ChatGPT API.

# üîë Key System Design: Secure Auth Flow

A critical requirement of this project is the secure, server-side handling of OAuth2 authentication.

**Rule:** Direct client-side authentication with a provider (e.g., using a package like react-google-login that communicates directly with Google) is strictly forbidden. All communication must be proxied through the auth-service.

**Correct Authentication Flow:**

1. **React Client:** User clicks "Login with Google."  
2. **Request:** React client sends a request to the auth-service (e.g., `/api/auth/google/login`).  
3. **auth-service (Server):** Generates a state token and redirects the user's browser to the Google OAuth consent screen.  
4. **Google:** User authenticates and grants permission.  
5. **Redirect:** Google redirects the user back to the auth-service callback URI (e.g., `/api/auth/google/callback`) with an authorization code.  
6. **auth-service (Server):**
   - Verifies the state token.
   - Exchanges the authorization code with Google for an access token and user profile.
   - Saves/updates the user info and provider token in its own database.
   - Generates a new, internal JWT (or session) for the user.  
7. **React Client:** The server sends this internal JWT back to the React client, which stores it (e.g., in localStorage or a cookie) to authenticate future API requests.

**Security Notes:**

- This flow explicitly avoids storing provider tokens or secrets on the client side.  
- The auth-service is responsible for token refresh and secure storage.

# üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

The project is configured for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using GitHub Actions and AWS.

- **Trigger:** A push or merge to the `main` branch initiates the GitHub Actions workflow.

**Build:**
- The workflow builds the Go applications (compiling binaries).  
- It builds the React application (static assets).  
- It prepares the Python service.

**Dockerize:**
- A separate Docker image is built for each service (frontend, products-service, auth-service, chatbot-service).

**Push:**
- The newly built Docker images are tagged and pushed to a container registry (e.g., AWS ECR).

**Notify:**
- Upon a successful build, a notification is sent via email.

**Deploy:**
- The workflow triggers a deployment on AWS.
  - This instructs the AWS instances (e.g., ECS tasks, EC2 instances) to pull the new Docker images from ECR and restart the containers, completing the deployment.
